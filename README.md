## Objectives
1. Apply an apropriate preprocessing for text documents, using stopwords removal, lemmatization and vectorization by TF-IDF (https://github.com/mayarachew/20newsgroups/blob/main/auxiliar_functions/preprocessing.py);
2. Classificate each text document in one of the 20 newsgroups categories;
3. Compare classification techniques, such as Support Vector Machine,  Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron and k-Nearest Neighbors (https://github.com/mayarachew/20newsgroups/blob/main/classification.ipynb);
4. Visualize the dataset on a Scatter Plot;
5. Compare visualization/dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-SNE, PCA, MDS and UMAP (https://github.com/mayarachew/20newsgroups/blob/main/visualization.ipynb);
6. Apply K-means clustering algorithm.
